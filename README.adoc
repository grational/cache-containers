= cache-containers

The project offers a generic interface `CacheContainer` and a couple of its implementations to create a transparent permanent compressed cache stored externally:

. `CacheFile` that uses an external file as cache store. It uses a file stored in the `JDK` defined temporary directory of the filesystem by default 
. `CacheRedis` that leverages the external Redis nosql server to store the data
